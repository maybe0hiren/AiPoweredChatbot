**A chatbot that runs locally on llama3 named JOKSHUMADHINI.**
Why Jokshumadhini? ---- A random set of alphabets that popped up in my mind!

**Prerequisites**
  llama3:
    --> Download **Ollama** from https://ollama.com/
    --> Install **llama3** or any other model using ollama
        (Refer this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0o89z134CQ for installation of the model)
  
include/nlohmann/json.hpp is used from the repo: https://github.com/nlohmann/json

Open the folder in terminal and make a chatbot executable file my typing "make"
Run the executable file to access the chatbot.

You can change the username and the bot's name from src/chatbot.cpp : Line 18 and Line 35
